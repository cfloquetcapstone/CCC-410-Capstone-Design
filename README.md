# CCC-410-Capstone-Design

In the doldrums of quarantine I pulled out dusty old bins of Lego bricks from my childhood, and thought about spending some time sorting them. \

In about 5 minutes, I gave up on the idea of sorting the hundreds of pounds of Lego by hand, and entertained the idea of building a machine learning algorithm to both ID the individual brick, and then have some sort of sorting mechanism. \

Iâ€™ve been interested in image processing, machine learning, and building neural networks ever since I graduated highschool, but I never had a project that seemed to fit and I never had the knowledge of how to get started.
